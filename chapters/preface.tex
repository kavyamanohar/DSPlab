\chapter*{Preface} 

This laboratory manual has been prepared as a guideline to help students of undergraduate courses to carry out basic experiments in analog communication in the laboratory. This book is written in a way that a student with basic understanding on electronic circuit theory can learn the theory and experiment the basics of analog communication techniques.

Along with circuit components, introductions, an appendix section which discuss the data sheet details of that component is provided. Every experiment is explained with associated circuit diagrams, which were drawn using gEDA schemetic editor. Signal waveforms associated with the experiments were simulated in octave and given along with the experiment. Data, documents or diagrams used in the 
book which were taken from external sources are linked to the original sources as footnotes.

This is a work in progress version of the laboratory manual. Suggestions on improvement in conceptual clarity, diagrams, typography are most welcome. Share whatever you feel about the book- it is yours.
